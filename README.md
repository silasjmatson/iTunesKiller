# iTunesKiller
============

Kills iTunes whenever it tries to open. Noninvasive. If you want iTunes to start, close the app.

Clone, build, modify, do whatever you want with it.

# Todo

1. Make into a menu bar app
1. Possibly abstract and allow the user to add other default apps they want disabled the same way, but can't get rid of. (like iTunes)


# Contributing

1. Clone
1. Create a branch
1. Create a PR

# Tests?!

Meh. Prototype. Swift. *actually, I just don't know what I'm doing*
